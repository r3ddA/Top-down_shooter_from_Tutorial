# JATS FY

JATS FY is a Top-Down Shooter I'm making as a "masterpiece" for my school. I choosed this project to give myself a challenge.

I made it following a tutorial from youtube so basically a lot of the code you will find is taken from those video.      
(I will link the playlist of the channel in the Contributing section)

JATS FY is an acronym for "Just A Top-down Shooter From Youtube", I decided to name it this because anything didn't came to mind.


The game is built all in game maker studio because it's pretty good for 2D games and it is easy to learn.

I will update it in this months ahead because I want to go forward with the project and implementing more and more stuff.
But for now I will just have the base game, without a menu, boss, and lots of idea I have in mind that can't be done now due to time related problems.

## Contributing
I'm making this game using a playlist of tutorial from youtube called "How to make a Top-Down Shooter in Game Maker" (inserisci il link), so really a lot of code I'm using is written following the tutorial.
